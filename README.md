## Overview

Athen-AI is an intelligent conversational assistant designed to enhance user engagement with Thenaâ€™s DeFi ecosystem. It leverages advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques to provide users with relevant information and assistance regarding Thena's products and services.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Users can interact with Athen-AI through a chat interface, asking questions and receiving informative responses.
- **Document Processing**: The assistant can load and chunk documents, allowing it to provide contextually relevant answers based on the content of Thena's documentation.
- **Embedding and Retrieval**: Utilizes Sentence Transformers and FAISS for efficient text embedding and retrieval, ensuring quick access to relevant information.
- **Claude API Integration**: Generates responses using the Claude API, ensuring high-quality and context-aware answers.

## Installation and Running Locally

To set up the Athen-AI environment and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and clone the repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
   Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of the cloned repository.

3. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Ensure you have [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installed on your machine. Then run the setup script to create a conda environment and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   bash init_setup.sh
   ```

4. **Setting Up Environment Variables**:
   Before running the application, you need to set up the required environment variables, specifically your Claude API key. You can do this in two ways:

   - **Using Streamlit Secrets**:
     Create a file named `secrets.toml` in the `.streamlit` directory of your project (create the directory if it doesn't exist) and add the following content:
     ```toml
     [general]
     CLAUDE_API_KEY = "your_claude_api_key_here"
     ```

   - **Using Environment Variables**:
     Alternatively, set the environment variable directly in your terminal:
     ```bash
     export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your_claude_api_key_here"
     ```
     Make sure to run this command in the terminal before starting the Streamlit application.

5. **Verify the Setup**:
   You can verify that the environment variable is set correctly by running:
   ```bash
   echo $CLAUDE_API_KEY
   ```
   This should output your Claude API key. If it does not, please check your setup.

6. **Prepare Your Document**:
   Ensure you have the document you want to process (e.g., `thena_docs.md`) in the project directory or update the `document_path` variable in `main.py` to point to the correct file location.

7. **Run the Streamlit Application**:
   Start the Streamlit application by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

8. **Open the Application in Your Browser**:
   After running the command, Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`). Open this URL in your web browser to access the Athen-AI chat interface.

9. **Interact with Athen-AI**:
   Type your questions in the chat input and interact with the assistant.

## Code Structure

### Main Components

- **API Key Management**: The application retrieves the Claude API key from environment variables or Streamlit secrets.
- **Document Loading and Chunking**: The `load_and_chunk_document` function reads a document and splits it into manageable chunks for processing.
- **Text Embedding**: The `embed_texts` function uses Sentence Transformers to convert text chunks into embeddings for efficient retrieval.
- **FAISS Indexing**: The `build_faiss_index` function creates an index for the embeddings, allowing for quick searches.
- **Query Processing**: The `find_most_relevant_chunk` function retrieves the most relevant document chunks based on user queries.
- **Response Generation**: The `generate_claude_response` function interacts with the Claude API to generate responses based on the context and user query.

### Streamlit Interface

- The Streamlit app is initialized with a title and chat interface.
- User messages are stored in the session state, allowing for a continuous conversation.
- The assistant's responses are generated based on the most relevant document chunks retrieved from the FAISS index.

## Usage Examples

Here are some example questions you can ask Athen-AI:
- "What is the purpose of the THENA ecosystem?"
- "How do I provide liquidity on THENA?"
- "Can you explain the tokenomics of THE?"

## Conclusion

Athen-AI serves as a powerful tool for enhancing user engagement within the Thena ecosystem. By leveraging advanced technologies and adhering to specific communication guidelines, it aims to provide users with a seamless and informative experience in the DeFi space.
